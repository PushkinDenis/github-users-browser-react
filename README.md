# Welcome to GitHub users browser!

## This project was made with Atomic Design Methodology, React, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI,React Router, Eslint, Prettier, SCSS and deployed to GitHub Pages useing GitHubActions.

In this application, we fetch data of GitHub useres useing GitHub REST API.
You can push **_USERS_** - it will show a list of first GitHub users.
Then you can paginate through lists of users useing **_pagination_** element.
In user's cards from lists you can see some basic user's information, such as:
login, id, html address, avatar etc.

Also you can use **_search input_** to try to find user by his login.

## Thanks for your attention!
